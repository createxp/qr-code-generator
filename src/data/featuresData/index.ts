Create Different Profiles
If you offer multiple services, our tool allows you to create different profiles for each service. This means you can easily calculate the hourly rate and service subtotal for each profile, saving you time and effort.
Calculate Subtotal for Each Service
Once you have created a profile, simply add the service you want to offer and enter the number of hours required. Our tool will then calculate the subtotal for you, so you know exactly how much to charge your clients.
Export/Download Quotations
Once you have calculated your prices, you can easily export them as a CSV or download them as a PNG. This makes it easy to share your quotations with clients and keep track of your pricing history.

Easily provide accurate pricing to clients in different countries by selecting from a range of currencies.
Login availability
